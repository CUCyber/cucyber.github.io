### Time Management


#### What is Time Management?

* Time management is the ability to plan and control how you spend the hours in your day to effectively accomplish your goals.

Note:
In the same way that your mailman needs an address to deliver mail to your house, computers need an address to know where to send data to talk to each other.


#### Important Time Management Skills

* Prioritization
* Self Awareness
* Stress Management

Note:
Prioritization - Decide which tasks are more important and which tasks can wait
Self Awareness - Understand your abilities and limitations
Stress Management - Stress can slow you down


#### Why is this relevant to Cyber Defense Competitions?

* Injects
	- Injects will come through out the competition.
	- They will make you prioritize certain task over others to see them completed.
* Red Team
	- When red team hacks your box, your time management skills will be tested.
* Managers are going to be busy
	- Your team leaders will not always have time to reorganize your task.



## Writing a Proper Email


### The Greeting

* Never use informal greeting ("hi" or "sup")
* Call people by their title if their full name is not known (Director of Communication)


### The Body

* Check for spelling and grammar
* Never use text shortcuts ("u")
* Keep email as concise as possible
* Make sure your email is clear and includes all necessary information.


### Conclusion

* Include your full name, job title, and organization



## Communicating with Customers


### Communicating with Customers

* Be as polite as possible
* Stray away from technical jargon
* Always stay positive and use positive statements
* Actively listen to the customer
* Do **NOT** interrupt them

Note:
Positive statements:
* "I really appreciate your patience."
* "Thank you for bringing this to our attention."
You're part of customer service now. Use phrases like:
* "I understand how frustrating that must be".
* "I've passed this on to our team."
* "Thank you for being our customer."


### Why is this relevant to a Cyber Security Competition?

* Email is a primary means of communication
* You will have to talk to people of a higher company standing
* You will have to talk with many "customers"


## Incident Response Forms


### Incident Response Forms

* An organized apporach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach
* Usually done by a team called the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)


#### Incident Response Form Best Practices

* Preparation
* Identification
* Containment
* Eradication
* Recovery
* Lessons Learned

Note:
Preparation - Prepare the team on how to handle certain incidents.
Identification - Recognize a security breach as soon as possible.
Containment - Limit the damage of the breach as much as possible.
Eradication - Fix the security breach.
Recovery - Restore your system to the best of your ability.
Lessons Learned - Record what happened and figure out how to not let it happen again.


### Why is this relevant to a Cyber Security Competition?

* Compromises **will** happen during competitions.
* Bad incident responses will cause your team to lose out on points.

* Meant to keep track of all changes that have been made on a server

* Additions the system
* Subtractions to the system
* Deprecated services or feature to remove
