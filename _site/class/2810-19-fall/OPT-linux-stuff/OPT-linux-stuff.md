## Living with Linux



# "Software Diversity"


## Linux is fragmented, kinda

* Linux has hundreds if not thousands of distributions or "distros"
* Most of these are completely independent operating systems
* Their common point is the Linux kernel.


## What does each distro do differently?

* Default user software
* System software
* Kernel
* Philosophy
* Branding


## So why are they lumped together?

* Because it's easier
* Most of the software is the same
* There's a lot of cross-development



# Common Distros


## Ubuntu

* Most popular distro
* Beginner friendly
* Server and desktop variants


## Debian

* Ubuntu is based off of this
* Long history of success


## CentOS & Fedora

* CentOS is based off of RHEL
* Fedora is the testing grounds for RHEL
* CentOS is server-focused
* Fedora is desktop-focused


## Arch (btw)

* No installer
* Great documentation


## Gentoo

* What Arch users aspire to be

## What are you going to see in the real world?

* Stuff with support contracts and Ubuntu

This leaves:

* Ubuntu
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux
* SUSE


## What are you going to see in a cyberdefense competition?
* Ubuntu
* CentOS/RHEL
* Debian


# Interacting with Linux


## The Shell

## TTY/SSH

* **T**ele**TY**pewriter
* Don't actually call it that or people will make fun of you


## TTY/SSH Pros

* Keyloggers are harder here (not impossible)
* Really easy on the GPU, CPU, and RAM
* More accessible


## TTY/SSH Cons

* No GUIs\*
* Limited flexibility with having multiple instances\*


## GUI Pros

* Increased flexibility and usability
* Play cool games while your code compiles


## GUI Cons

* No centralized desktop environment so they ~~all suck~~ have software diversity



# TTY Survival Handbook


## Rule 1: TUIs are just as good as GUIs


## Rule 2: Scream for Screen


## Rule 3: Man pages can be searched


## Rule 4: UP UP UP


## Rule 5: TAB TAB TAB


## Rule 6: If you're not sure, check the distro
