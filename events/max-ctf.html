                    <p>Greetings member of CU Cyber,</p>

                    <p>We received an email from the IT department at East Coast Hospitals that we would like you to check out:</p>

                    <blockquote>Hello! My name is Dan and I'm so glad we hired you to do our internal security audit. My job is to do IT around the hospital. I had to set up every server in this place as well as do most of the programming. I'm not a programmer, so you may find a few security issues there, but it can't be too bad, can it? I don't have a network diagram to give you, but I'll let you figure it out.</blockquote>

                    <p>They would like us to do some penetration testing on their environment, so we need your help to find the vulnerabilities. The goal of the competition is to exploit vulnerabilities in their applications to find "flags" that you can submit to a scoreboard to gain points. To participate, you'll need to get OpenVPN credentials to the hospital network. You'll probably also want to install the recommended tools below. Support for getting connected or inquiries is available at our email, <a href="mailto:cyber@clemson.edu">cyber@clemson.edu</a>, and via our Discord server, <a href="#">https://discord.gg/[removed]</a>, channel #ctf.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Credentials</h3>

                    <p>Email memes and the rules to <a href="mailto:cyber@clemson.edu">cyber@clemson.edu</a> from your Clemson email and we will email you back a .ovpn file to connect to the competition network. Put "Max's CTF" in the subject. If you aren't comfortable sending memes, you're allowed to only send the rules.</p>

                    <h3>Discord</h3>

                    <p>Our main channel of communication is Discord. It's an "all-in-one voice and text chat thatâ€™s free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone". It's essentially a better version of Skype and TeamSpeak. Here we discuss upcoming events, talk about random things we find on the internet, get help on whatever problems we have, and post an abundance of memes. If you want to get to know your fellow club members or have any questions, it's an invaluable resource.</p>

                    <p>All discussion of the CTF will be in #ctf on Discord. If you need help, some guidance, or just have a general question, feel free to post it in here!</p>

                    <p>Discord use is not required, but if you'd like to join, and I really recommend you do, click the link below.</p>

                    <p><a href="#">https://discord.gg/[removed]</a></p>

                    <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
