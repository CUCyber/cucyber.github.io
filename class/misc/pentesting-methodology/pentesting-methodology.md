## Overview

* An introduction to how attackers (red team) perform attacks on computer networks.



## Learning Objectives


* Outline the steps an attacker takes to find and exploit potential vulnerabilities in a network.



## Intro to the Pentesting Methodology


### Information Gathering

* Use nmap to gather network information about the server
* Determine what services are running, what version of each service is running
* Google each service version to look for known vulnerabilities and exploits
* If a web server is running, use tools like dirbuster, dirb, or gobuster to find hidden directories


### Exploitation

* Typically, the main objective of exploitation is gain remote code execution on a server
* Most commonly you will be relying on pre-made exploits for outdated software


### Privilege Escalation

* Privilege escalation (for Linux) often comes in the form of kernel vulnerabilties
* Other forms of privesc are misconfigurations in file permissions or vulnerabilities in local services running as root

1. Use Nmap to find the services running on your server
2. Navigate to your server's IP in your web browser
3. Discover a vulnerability in the web server called Shellshock
4. Use curl or metasploit to create a reverse shell on the server
5. Use DirtyCoW to escalate to root privileges
6. Submit a screenshot of your success on Canvas
