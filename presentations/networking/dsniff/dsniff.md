# What is DSniff?


## What is DSniff?

* a suite of utilities for the purposes of networking sniffing
* useful to show what data your network traffics
* useful to find sensitive information on a network
* useful to show how the traditional stateless ARP scheme is insecure

Note:
It has very strong Red and Blue reasons for existing. We will be using it in a Red fashion to demonstrate that not everything that looks secure is secure.


## What can DSniff do?

* poison the ARP cache
* forge DNS responses
* stage a MITM attack for SSHv1 and HTTP
* kill TCP connections
* perform traffic shaping as a client
* analyze network traffic
* cause unintelligent switches to fail open
