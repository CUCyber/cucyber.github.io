# Homework 1

You have been tasked with auditing a virtual machine **in groups of 2**. It is an Ubuntu 16.04 installation and its primary function is being a webserver. As such, it should only be running the Apache2 service. Since it is a webserver, we want to allow HTTP traffic through the firewall.


Your task is to note at least 3 issues wrong with the system as well as the steps/commands necessary to correct the problems. Create a short report containing this information and submit to Canvas by the due date. Only one partner has to turn in the assignment, but the names of both team members must be present.


You can access this machine within the lab environment. Please refer to the following link for infstructions on how to connect to the lab: [https://cucyber.net/wiki/lab/connecting.html](https://cucyber.net/wiki/lab/connecting.html)

**Due Date:** Tuesday, September 11th, 5:59 PM on Canvas

### Some hints:
* /var/www/ is the Apache2 data directory.
* /etc/passwd is a file used to keep track of every registered user that has access to a system. 
* ufw is the firewall on this system.
