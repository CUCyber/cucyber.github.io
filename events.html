                        <p>This Thursday, we are bringing in a guest speaker Jerry Perullo, the CISO of Intercontinental Exchange. He will be talking about what a cyber security program is like in a business environment.</p>
                        <h3>Bio</h3>
                        <p>Jerry Perullo has served as the Chief Information Security Officer of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE) since 2001.  Perullo leads the cybersecurity program for all of Intercontinental Exchange, including the New York Stock Exchange, securing critical economic infrastructure across multiple subsidiaries, geographies, and regulatory jurisdictions.  Further, his team is responsible for cybersecurity across regulated futures and options exchanges, central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs), trade repositories, equities venues, and systemically important financial market utilities (SIFMUs).</p>
                        <p>Perullo works closely with the US Department of Treasury and the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (FSSCC) in addition to many governmental, regulatory, and industry bodies around the world.  Perullo was elected to the Board of Directors of the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), where he has been an active leader since 2007.  Within the FS-ISAC and the London-based World Federation of Exchanges, respectively, he co-founded the CHEF and GLEX domestic-US and global information sharing networks of cybersecurity leaders in the Exchange and Clearinghouses spaces, which have served as crucial interface points between the public and private sectors during times of crisis.  Perullo also works closely with the cybersecurity technology industry, serving on several industry advisory boards and working closely with investors and entrepreneurs who are developing solutions to pressing challenges, and has been published and featured as an expert speaker at numerous cybersecurity events.</p>
                        <p>Prior to ICE, Perullo led an Information Security practice providing penetration testing and consulting services to the health-care, energy, and data service industries after successfully building an Internet Service Provider in the mid-1990s.</p>
                        <p>Perullo studied Computer Engineering at Clemson University and earned a BS degree in Legal Studies from the University of Maryland and an MBA from Georgia State University.  He serves on the Industry Advisory Board of the Georgia Tech Institute for Information Security and Privacy (IISP) and has guest-lectured and instructed there and at other Universities.</p>
