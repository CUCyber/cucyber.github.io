2. Discuss how you got hacked and analyze the machines
3. Write a group report on:
  - Three ways you got hacked
  - How those issues could have been prevented
  - How to clean up what the attackers did on the machine

Note:

### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures

* We categorize actions hackers do into TTPs
* Tactics are the "why"
  * Initial Access
  * Persistence
* Techniques are the "how"
  * Use of Valid Accounts (T1078)
  * Create Account (T1136)

Note:
* Procedures aren't really a thing anymore, but you'll hear TTP a lot

* ATT&CK - Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge
* https://attack.mitre.org/

Note:
* ATT&CK is a list of TTPs that are well known
* Blue teams now use ATT&CK to categorize an attackers operation
* Go over each tactic to make sure students know what each one is



### Activity

* Get back into RvB groups
* Use ATT&CK to categorize how you got hacked

Note:
* Take 10 minutes



### Incident Response

* Investigation
* Identification
* Remediation
* Recovery
* Report

Note:
* Investigation - Find out what attackers have done by checking things like bash history, event logs, etc
* Identification - Identify issue
* Remediation - Fix issue
* Recovery - Recover any lost data

Note:
* Some organizations only want to do phishing since they think initial access is important
* Assumed breach means that we should assume there is already an operator in our network
* How can we make their life hell?
