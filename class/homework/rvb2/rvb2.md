Red vs. Blue 2 Report

Write a report about your first Red vs. Blue experience.

Iâ€™m looking for the following things:

1. What box or service were you in charge of?
2. What steps did you take in order to secure the box?
3. How did your actions contribute to the overall increase in security of the box or service?
4. What injects did you complete (if any)?
5. What vulnerabilities did you find (if any)? If you found one, did you see it in the first Red vs. Blue? If not, what did you do differently that led to you finding it this time around?
6. What did you do differently from the last Red vs. Blue?
7. What should you do differently next time?

This should be roughly 4 paragraphs.
