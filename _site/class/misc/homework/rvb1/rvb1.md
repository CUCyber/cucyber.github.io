# Red vs. Blue 1 Report

Write a report about your first Red vs. Blue experience.

I'm looking for the following things:

1. What box or service were you in charge of?
2. What steps did you take in order to secure the box?
3. How did your actions contribute to the overall increase in security of the box or service?
4. What injects did you complete (if any)?

This should be roughly 2 paragraphs.
