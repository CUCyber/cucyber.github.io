## Activity



## How do we talk to another computer?

* IP Addresses - A suite of protocols for identification and addressing of connected computers
  - Example: 192.168.1.5
  - Example: 130.127.151.120
  - Example: ipv6 address

## How do we get an IP address?

* DHCP - A server on the network that hands out valid IP addresses within the network
* Static - You define the network and the ip address that your machine will have



## How does traffic get from one host to another?

* Routers all the way down!
* Routers usually have two interfaces
* Each router checks its routing table to determine the next hop
* There is an interface associated and the packet is sent out that interface


## How do we build the routing table?

* Dynamic routing
* Static routing

## Home NAT

* Your home ISP gives you one public IP.
* How do you have multiple devices on your home network?


## Private IP Ranges

* 192.168.0.0/16
  - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
* 10.0.0.0/8
  - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
* 172.16.0.0/12
  - 172.16.0.0 â€“ 172.31.255.255

## Port Forwarding

## Competition NAT

* At competitions you will be given a block of "public IPs"
* These will usually map directly to your internal IPs
* This is called 1:1 NAT
